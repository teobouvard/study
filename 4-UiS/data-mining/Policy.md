# Grading and Collaboration Policy

## Lab Assignments
All the three lab assignments must be completed to satisfaction (passed) in order to sit for the exam. Cooperating for assignments is tolerated only at the high level ideas but copying code is not allowed.

## Projects
The project accounts the 40 % of your grade. You will get a grade based on the novelty, quality and complexity of the project, along with the ability to show use of appropriate models, preprocessing techniques and evaluation strategies. The projects are done in groups of 3. Not all team members may get the same grade. Individual grades are decided based on a short oral exam.

## Plagiarism Warning  

Any form of cheating, plagiarism, i.e. copying of another student’s text or source code, will result in the grade F, and immediate disqualification from the course and may be reported to the university for administrative processing. Copying code from fellow students and borrowing code from past year also counts as cheating. You may collaborate ideas with your fellow students but do not copy the code. It is perfectly fine to get help from fellow students to debug something or get tips if you are stuck somewhere but copying code is forbidden. We will do plagiarism detection using a software which takes into account same with only minor changes to structure of the code, method names or variables. Committing acts that violate Student Conduct policies that result in course disruption are cause for suspension or dismissal from UiS. 

Don’t cheat. It’s not worth it!
